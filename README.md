This project is designed to assess my proficiency with React.js by
interacting with an API to retrieve data. Users can register, log in,
create, edit, and delete posts. Additionally, users can browse posts
from other authors, add them to their favorites list, and view all liked
posts. Each user can view all posts by a specific author or a single
post, which includes the description, creation date, author's name, and
photo. A filtering feature allows users to find posts by username, post
title, or date. Users who are not logged in can access the home page and
all posts page to see all posts or posts from a specific author.

#Not Logged-in User Capabilities:
-Access the home page.
